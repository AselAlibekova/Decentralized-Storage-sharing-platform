**Project Overview**

The Decentralized Storage Sharing Platform is a blockchain-based dApp that allows users to rent storage space or offer their own storage for others to rent. By utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, the platform ensures secure and transparent storage transactions between users without the need for intermediaries. Users can pay for storage using cryptocurrency (ETH), and providers can list their available storage space with specific pricing and capacity. All transactions are handled by a smart contract, which guarantees payment and service execution.

This project integrates blockchain technology for decentralized data storage, user registration, and payment management, combining security, transparency, and decentralized control.

**Key Features:**

Decentralized Storage Rental: Users can list available storage space with pricing and capacity, while renters can pay for storage directly via smart contracts.

Smart Contract Integration: The platform leverages Ethereum smart contracts to handle listings, payments, and rentals in a secure and automated manner.

User Authentication: Users can sign up or log in using MongoDB to store credentials securely.

MetaMask Integration: Transactions are performed through MetaMask to ensure safe interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

Responsive Design: A user-friendly web interface built with EJS and Node.js for seamless interaction with the dApp.

**How it Works:**

Sign Up / Log In: Users register or log in using email and password.

Add Listing: Storage providers list their available space, specifying details like size and price.

Rent Storage: Users browse available storage options and can rent space by paying with ETH through MetaMask.

Smart Contract Execution: Once the rental is confirmed, the smart contract handles the payment and logs the transaction securely on the blockchain.

Technologies Used:

Ethereum Blockchain & Smart Contracts: For decentralized data storage and transaction processing.
Node.js & Express.js: Server-side code for handling requests and communication between the front end, blockchain, and MongoDB.


MongoDB: Used for storing user data like emails and passwords.
MetaMask: Browser-based wallet for handling cryptocurrency transactions.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript): For rendering dynamic views on the server.

Web3.js: A JavaScript library to interact with Ethereum smart contracts.
